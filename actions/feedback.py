Iris Feedback Module - Auditory & Visual Feedback System
=========================================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (Simple English):
  This file is the "voice" and "screen announcer" of Iris. Whenever Iris completes
  a task, needs to answer a question, or warns the user, this module speaks the answer
  out loud through the computer speakers and prints a clear message on the screen.
  It speaks in both English and Hindi naturally.

GREAT TECH & PACKAGES USED IN THIS FILE:
  - pyttsx3:
      * What it does: Offline Text-to-Speech synthesizer using native Windows SAPI5 voices.
      * Why we use it: Works 100% offline with zero latency and zero internet requirement.
      * Benefit: Essential for visually impaired users who need instantaneous spoken responses.
  - gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):
      * What it does: Converts Hindi and Indian English text into natural, human-sounding speech.
      * Why we use it: Standard Windows English TTS voices often pronounce Hindi words incorrectly.
        gTTS provides authentic, fluent Hindi pronunciation.
  - pygame.mixer:
      * What it does: Low-latency audio playback engine.
      * Why we use it: Plays gTTS audio directly from memory (RAM) via io.BytesIO without ever
        creating temporary MP3 files on disk. This keeps the disk clean and playback fast.
  - threading.Lock:
      * What it does: Thread synchronization lock.
      * Why we use it: Prevents multiple speech threads from talking over each other simultaneously.
