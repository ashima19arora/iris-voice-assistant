"""
Iris Security Guardrail Package - Multi-Layer Defense System
=============================================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (Simple English):
  This is the security "firewall" and gatekeeper of Iris. Before any command touches
  your operating system, browser, or files, it passes through this unified gatekeeper.
  It screens for harmful words (like "delete windows", "format drive", "wipe files"),
  validates that requested apps are on the safety whitelist, blocks unsafe URL protocols,
  and records an in-memory safety log. If a command is dangerous, Iris blocks it immediately
  and warns you out loud.

GREAT TECH & CONCEPTS IN THIS PACKAGE:
  - Multi-Tier Risk Evaluation (Tiers 0 to 4):
      * What it does: Classifies commands into Safe, Standard, Caution, Elevated, or Forbidden.
  - Parameter Sandboxing:
      * What it does: Validates that inputs cannot break out of their intended sandbox.
