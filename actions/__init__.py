Iris Native Actions Package - Public API & Automation Gateway
==============================================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (Simple English):
  This is the main "front door" of the actions package. When the assistant hears your
  speech, it calls `actions.execute_command(text)`. This file brings together all the
  individual action tools—browser controls, form filling, window management, system diagnostics,
  instant Q&A, and bilingual speech—into one clean, unified interface.

GREAT TECH & PACKAGES USED ACROSS THIS PACKAGE:
  - pyautogui & pyperclip: Universal keyboard, mouse, and clipboard automation across all Windows apps.
  - psutil: Hardware status inspection (RAM, CPU, Battery charge).
  - requests: Fast instant knowledge retrieval from Wikipedia REST and DuckDuckGo APIs.
  - pyttsx3 & gTTS: Dual-engine Text-to-Speech for fluent English and authentic Hindi voice feedback.
