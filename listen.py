"""
Iris Single-Shot Voice Command Listener
========================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (Simple English):
  This is a standalone diagnostic tool for testing microphone input and speech recognition
  in a single run. You run `python listen.py`, speak a single command, and it transcribes
  your speech. (Action execution via the `actions` package will be added in a later stage --
  the import below is a placeholder and will raise an error until that package exists here.)

GREAT TECH & PACKAGES USED IN THIS FILE:
  - onnx_asr (NVIDIA NeMo Parakeet TDT 0.6B int8):
      * What it does: Local quantized neural Speech-to-Text model.
      * Why we use it: Accurate transcription on CPU without requiring an expensive GPU or cloud API.
  - speech_recognition:
      * What it does: Captures audio from the microphone and cuts off when silence is detected.
      * Why we use it: Adjusted to snappy 0.8s silence cutoff so it stops recording as soon as
        you finish speaking rather than hanging.
  - soundfile & numpy:
      * What it does: In-memory raw WAV decoding into floating point arrays for Parakeet.
