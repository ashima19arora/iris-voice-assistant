"""
Iris Interactive Voice Assistant - Main Execution Runtime
===========================================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES (Simple English):
  This is the primary heartbeat of Iris. It continuously listens to your microphone,
  converts your spoken words into text using an offline neural speech-to-text model,
  understands your intent, and triggers the computer to perform the action (e.g. fill
  forms, control windows, search websites, or answer questions).
  It also features an automatic 45-second sleep mode to save CPU when you are not speaking.

NOTE (repo status): this file imports the `actions` package for intent parsing and
execution, which has NOT been added to this repo yet -- it will be added in a later
stage. Running this file right now will raise an ImportError at startup. Use listen.py
in the meantime to test the speech-to-text layer on its own.

GREAT TECH & PACKAGES USED IN THIS FILE:
  - onnx_asr (NVIDIA NeMo Parakeet TDT 0.6B int8):
      * What it does: High-speed, local neural Speech-to-Text (Automatic Speech Recognition).
      * Why we use it: Transcribes voice in real-time (~0.1s on standard CPU) without sending
        private user voice recordings to external cloud servers.
      * Benefit: Completely private, zero cloud latency, and works even without fast internet.
  - speech_recognition:
      * What it does: Hardware microphone audio capture and silence detection.
      * Why we use it: Continuously streams audio from the user's microphone with ambient
        noise filtering and responsive pause detection.
      * Benefit: Automatically detects when you finish speaking (0.8s silence) and cuts off
        instantly so you never have to wait.
  - soundfile & numpy:
      * What it does: Ultra-fast mathematical audio buffer decoding in RAM.
      * Why we use it: Converts raw microphone WAV bytes directly into float32 arrays in under 2ms.
